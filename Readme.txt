AdBlocker v 1.1
This utility blocks out about 80-90% of the ads you get to see on websites by modifying the contents of your system's hosts file. It also gives you an option of deleting cookies as soon as they are created, thus helping you to protect your privacy (esp. from sites like doubleclick.net). Since the ads are not loaded into your browser, you surfing speed increases considerably! This app. also runs a web server on port 80 of your system, the redirecting all incoming requests for ads to your system's web server. You may use this server to display and appropriate message or picture.

The supplied file hosts.svr contains the names of 200 most offending ad servers and it should be present along with the exe in the same directory.
Some mail servers need a cookie enabled browser, so please disable cookie killing while browsing such sites. The first submission I made really messed up the hosts file on some systems. If you have downloaded the previous version before then please check your systems hosts file and edit/delete it if required.

This has not been tested on WinNT. You may need administrative rights to modify the hosts file on a NT system. 
Cookie names will show up in the "temporary internet files" folder even if they  have been deleted, but whenever you try to open them, you will get a "file not found error" (thats if you use cookie killing)

Location of hosts file
Win95/98 c:\windows
WinNT    c:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc

Location of Cookies folder
Win95/98  c:\windows\cookies
WinNT	c:\winnnt\username\cookies
