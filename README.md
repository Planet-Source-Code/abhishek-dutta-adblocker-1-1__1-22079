### Description

Updated version of AdBlocker I submitted a few days back.Blocks ads on webpages making them load faster. Also displays an AD Blocked message in place of ads!
 
### More Info
 
The first submission I made really messed up the hosts file on some systems. If you have downloaded the previous version before then please check your systems hosts file and edit/delete it if required.
